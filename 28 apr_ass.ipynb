    "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering algorithm that aims to create a hierarchy of clusters by recursively partitioning or merging data points based on their similarity. \n",

    "\n",
    "Hierarchy: Hierarchical clustering produces a hierarchical structure of clusters, often represented as a dendrogram. This structure allows for exploration at different \n",
    "levels of granularity, from individual data points to larger clusters. In contrast, other clustering techniques like K-means or DBSCAN typically provide a single \n",
    "partitioning solution without capturing hierarchical relationships.\n",

    "Agglomerative or Divisive: Hierarchical clustering can be performed in two ways: agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down). Agglomerative clustering starts with \n",
    "individual data points and merges them iteratively, while divisive clustering begins with all data points in one cluster and splits them recursively. Other clustering \n",
    "techniques, such as K-means, involve partitioning the data into distinct clusters without considering a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity/Dissimilarity Measures: Hierarchical clustering relies on a distance or similarity measure to determine the similarity between data points. Common distance\n",
    "measures include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or correlation coefficients. Other clustering techniques may use different similarity or dissimilarity measures \n",

    "Agglomerative Clustering: Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point as a separate cluster and iteratively merges clusters based on their similarity.\n",
